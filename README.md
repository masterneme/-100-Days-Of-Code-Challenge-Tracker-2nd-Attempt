# 100-Days-Of-Code-Challenge-Tracker-2nd-Attempt

Repository created to track my progress on the [100 Days of code challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).  

Last time I couldn't finish because my Internet connection was shut down and was unable to access the material. This time I have gathered a lot of content so, even if that happens again, I can continue with the challenge offline.  

I'm going to focus on practicing Lua & [Defold Engine](https://defold.com/). Alternatively, I can learn & practice Javascript for web development.
